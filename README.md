## **Bussiness Problem -**

In this project, your task is to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts.

## **Steps performed -**

* Importing the libraries
* Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA
* splitting of the data :-
* RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) dataframe helps in solving problems in a particular order, making it easy to recommend and display new products to selected customers.
  
## **Modelling -**

* K-Means with Silhouette_score

* K-Means with Elbow Method

* Hierarchical Clustering

* DBSCAN

## **Conclusion**

* The majority of customers, at 88.92%, are from the United Kingdom. Other significant customer groups include Germany (2.30%), France (2.12%), Eire (1.84%), and Spain (0.63%). The remaining customers come from countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Portugal, and Australia.


* The top five products purchased based on frequency were White Hanging Heart, T-Light Holder, Regency Cakestand 3 Tier, Jumbo Bag Red Retrospot, Party Bunting, and Assorted Colour Bird Ornament.


* A large number of orders, 35.86%, were cancelled.If we analyze these cancelled orders it could help us to prevent cancellations in the future and most number of cancellation has been done from UK

* We can see that most number orders placed by United Kingdom(349227) which is one sided as compared to other countries.


* We can conclude that not only does the UK generate the highest sales revenues, but it also has the most customers. By exploring this further, we can gain insight into what products customers purchase together, as well as potential future opportunities in the UK market.
